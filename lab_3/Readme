/**************************************************************************/
Assignment 3(a):
	Design an LL(1) parser for the language you have used 
	in Assignment 2.The parser needs to call the lexical analyzer. 
	The Parser takes input as the source code, calls the lexical 
	analyzer to generate tokens and finally do parsing. The parser
	should also have the facility to take an arbitrary CFG and 
	generate LL(1)table and display it. Also, parsing stack should be
	displayed.Also include features like handling ambiguity, 
	elimination of left recursion etc. !!!!

Assignment 3(b):
	Implement a Parser using Yacc for the language used in 
	Assignment 1 (b).
